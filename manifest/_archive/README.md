# Manifest archive

Deprecated or exploratory manifests live here so day-to-day operators can focus on the stable slices in `manifest/`.

- Prefer `manifest/governance-mvp.xml` and `manifest/membership-core.xml` for normal deploys.
- Use `manifest/quarantine.xml` only when diagnosing or deliberately deploying quarantined metadata.
